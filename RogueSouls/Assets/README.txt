THIS IS NECESSARY WHEN CREATING ANY NEW SCENES IN ORDER FOR THE GAME TO FUNCTION PROPERLY

THINGS TO ADD TO YOUR SCENE

- ADD EVERYTHING FROM THE LEVEL FOLDER IN PREFABS
- ADD THE HANDLERS PREFAB AND SET UP EACH HANDLER ACCORDINGLY
- ADD A PLAYER PREFAB - NO SET UP NECESSARY (I RECOMMEND HIDING *NOT DISABLING* THE WARP OVERLAY OBJECT)
- ADD A CAMERA PREFAB TO THE SCENE - NO SET UP NECESSARY
- ADD A CROSSHAIR PREFAB TO THE SCENE - NO SET UP NECESSARY
