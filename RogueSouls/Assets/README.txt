THIS IS NECESSARY WHEN CREATING ANY NEW SCENES IN ORDER FOR THE GAME TO FUNCTION PROPERLY

MANUAL APPROACH

THINGS TO ADD TO YOUR SCENE

- ADD EVERYTHING FROM THE LEVEL FOLDER IN PREFABS
- ADD THE HANDLERS PREFAB AND SET UP EACH HANDLER ACCORDINGLY
- ADD A PLAYER PREFAB - NO SET UP NECESSARY (I RECOMMEND HIDING *NOT DISABLING* THE WARP OVERLAY OBJECT)
- ADD A CAMERA PREFAB TO THE SCENE - NO SET UP NECESSARY
- ADD A CROSSHAIR PREFAB TO THE SCENE - NO SET UP NECESSARY

PRESET APPROACH

- DUPLICATE THE "DEFAULT_LEVEL" SCENE AND RENAME TO MATCH WHATEVER LEVEL YOU ARE MAKING

FAQ

Q: "Why is my entire screen black in the editor?"
A: This is the warp overlay, simply just hide it from the heirarchy
